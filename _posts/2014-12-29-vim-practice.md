Firstly, I surly want to write the study note using Chinese, but that would not takes full use of the power
of vim, so I decide using English even though I have not passed CET6.

I think the power of vim is due to its extendible, flexible and customizable.
The first thing impressed me is the quickly moving in and between files. From the step moving -- hjkl to long
distance jumps corresponding jump-forward and jump-back like the browser forward and back button. It means 
the vim automatically records you moving.
You can map the frequently using command or a long key-stroke to a few key-stroke, This is very useful and flexible.
